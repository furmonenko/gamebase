# Project Plan â€“ GameBase: Personal Gaming Analytics & Discovery Tool

## ðŸ§  Project Summary

A two-person team is developing a small analytical system that collects, processes, stores, and visualizes video game data. The system is similar to Letterboxd, but for games. Data will be fetched from public APIs, transformed, analyzed, and optionally enhanced with a Telegram bot or ML features.
